# Alan's portfolio

<h2>Introduction</h1>

<p> Welcome to my data portfolio, i want to establish a place where i can keep all my data projects and demostrate the amazing and wonderful world of data. </p>

<p> A bit about me i've been working with data for greater part of the last decade, i was first expose to data as most people was excel. Realising there was a story from the numbers sitting in front of you, i began my life long learning journey with data. From extracting data using SQL, transforming data with Excel, R, Python and visualising data with PowerBI and Tableau. </p>

<p> My portfolio will provide data fundementals, data projects with different types analysis using statistics and data visualisations. </p>
